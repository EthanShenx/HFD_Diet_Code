!Series_summary	"Mammary glands were collected from female mice of various ages: pre puberty (2 weeks), pubescent (5 weeks), adult (10 weeks) and pregnant (12.5 days mid-pregnancy). Freshly sorted epithelial cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. In some cases, cells were further sorted into basal and luminal subsets. Cells were visualized under a microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to achieve 100bp paired-end reads or on an Illumina NextSeq to achieve 75bp paired-end reads."
