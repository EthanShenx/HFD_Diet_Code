High-quality goatskins are valuable byproducts usually produced by indigenous goat breeds with poorer production performance in Asia and Africa. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning goatskin's biomechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength) remain elusive. Mechanistic exploration of these traits could greatly aid the genetic improvement and genetic resource conservation of native breeds in these regions. To fulfill this purpose, we collected skin tissues from three goat breeds: Huai goat (HG), a Chinese native variety producing high-quality goatskins; Yudong meat goat (YDMG), a crossbreed of HG and Boer goat; Henan dairy goat (HNDG), a dairy goat breed.Scanning electronic microscopy analysis of skin tissues found that the collagen fiber diameters, collagen fibril diameters, and crimps significantly differed among the three goat breeds; however, collagen fibril diameters are similar in HG and HNDG. A sum of 230, 775, and 86 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from YDMG versus HNDG, HG versus HNDG, and YDMG versus HG, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that signaling pathways involved in fatty acid, retinol, steroid metabolisms, and GO items related to the physical properties of the skin (e.g., collagen-containing extracellular matrix) are significantly overrepresented in DEGs identified from meat versus dairy goats. Furthermore, 106 DEGs (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, and SPARC) showed specific expression patterns in HG and YDMG versus HNDG. Items about biophysical features of skin (e.g., extracellular matrix organization and ECM proteoglycans) are markedly enriched. Protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that two growth factors (IGF1 and PDGFD) are latent collagen and other ECM protein expression modulators.Ultrastructural analysis of goat skin tissues suggested that collagen fibril diameter is not a major factor affecting goatskin quality. Transcriptomic profiles unveiled core genes and associated biological processes potentially involved in regulating goatskin quality. These discoveries shined new light on deeper understanding the mechanisms of hide-related traits in goat and other livestock.© 2024. The Author(s).
Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer among women globally. Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in most cancers. Early BC detection before metastasis can enhance survival rates. Understanding BC metastasis mechanisms could aid in developing metastasis-specific treatments.The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in cancer progression is recognized, yet the importance of specific lncRNAs in BC, despite potential alterations, remains inadequately explored. We utilized bioinformatics tools to identify novel lncRNAs dysregulated in metastasis. To achieve this objective, the gene expression profile of GSE102484, encompassing metastatic and non-metastatic BC tissue samples, was analyzed using the limma package in R with cut-off criteria set at an adjusted p-value < 0.005 and |fold change (FC)| ≥ 0.5. We used WGCNA analysis to find co-expression genes for lncRNAs. Then, we identified hub genes and performed pathway enrichment to better understand the results. Considering the defined criteria, eight novels of dysregulated lncRNAs and top 10 miRNAs were identified.Dysregulated lncRNAs are found in yellow, green, brown, purple, and turquoise co-expression modules from WGCNA analysis. Enrichment analysis of these co-expressed modules revealed relevant pathways to metastasis, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and integrin cell-surface interactions, as well as regulation of HIF1-alpha. In addition, SDPR, TGFB1I1, ILF3, KIF4A, and COL5A1 were identified as hub genes. Based on DElncRNA-miRNADEmRNA connections and co-expression, we ultimately constructed lncRNA-associated ceRNA axes.The current study may identify novel lncRNAs implicated in BC metastasis; still, additional research is required to determine the potential functions of these lncRNAs in BC metastasis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
Background: Liver cancer is a common malignant tumor with an increasing incidence in recent years. We aimed to develop a model by integrating clinical information and multi-omics profiles of genes to predict survival of patients with liver cancer. Methods: The multi-omics data were integrated to identify liver cancer survival-associated signal pathways. Then, a prognostic risk score model was established based on key genes in a specific pathway, followed by the analysis of the relationship between the risk score and clinical features as well as molecular and immunologic characterization of the key genes included in the prediction model. The function experiments were performed to further elucidate the undergoing molecular mechanism. Results: Totally, 4 pathways associated with liver cancer patients' survival were identified. In the pathway of integrin cell surface interactions, low expression of COMP and SPP1, and low CNVs level of COL4A2 and ITGAV were significantly related to prognosis. Based on above 4 genes, the risk score model for prognosis was established. Risk score, ITGAV and SPP1 were the most significantly positively related to activated dendritic cell. COL4A2 and COMP were the most significantly positively associated with Type 1 T helper cell and regulatory T cell, respectively. The nomogram (involved T stage and risk score) may better predict short-term survival. The cell assay showed that overexpression of ITGAV promoted tumorigenesis. Conclusion: The risk score model constructed with four genes (COMP, SPP1, COL4A2, and ITGAV) may be used to predict survival in liver cancer patients.Copyright © 2024 Yu, Zhang, Li, Gu, Cao, Gong, Xie and Xu.
The delayed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has resulted in rising mortality rate and low survival rate that can be circumvented using potent theranostics biomarkers. The treatment gets complicated with delayed detection resulting in lowered 5-year relative survival rate. In our present study, we employed systems biology approach to identify central genes that play crucial roles in tumor progression. Pancreatic cancer genes collected from various databases were used to construct a statistically significant interactome with 812 genes that was further analysed thoroughly using topological parameters and functional enrichment analysis. The significant genes in the network were then identified based on the maximum degree parameter. The overall survival analysis indicated through hazard ratio [HR] and gene expression [log Fold Change] across pancreatic adenocarcinoma revealed the critical role of FN1 [HR 1.4; log2(FC) 5.748], FGA [HR 0.78; log2(FC) 1.639] FGG [HR 0.9; log2(FC) 1.597], C3 [HR 1.1; log2(FC) 2.637], and QSOX1 [HR 1.4; log2(FC) 2.371]. The functional significance of the identified hub genes signified the enrichment of integrin cell surface interactions and proteoglycan syndecan-mediated cell signaling. The differential expression, low overall survival and functional significance of FN1 gene implied its possible role in controlling metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, alternate splice variants of FN1 gene showed 10 protein coding transcripts with conserved cell attachment site and functional domains indicating the variants' potential role in pancreatic cancer. The strong association of the identified hub-genes can be better directed to design potential theranostics biomarkers for metastasized pancreatic tumor.© 2022.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive motor disorder that affects posture and gait due to contracture development. The purpose of this study is to analyze a possible relation between muscle stiffness and gene expression levels in muscle tissue of children with CP. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of gene transcripts was carried out in muscle biopsies from gastrocnemius muscle (n = 13 children with CP and n = 13 typical developed (TD) children). Passive stiffness of the ankle plantarflexors was measured. Structural changes of the basement membranes and the sarcomere length were measured. Twelve pre-defined gene target sub-categories of muscle function, structure and metabolism showed significant differences between muscle tissue of CP and TD children. Passive stiffness was significantly correlated to gene expression levels of HSPG2 (p = 0.02; R2 = 0.67), PRELP (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.84), RYR3 (p = 0.04; R2 = 0.66), C COL5A3 (p = 0.0007; R2 = 0.88), ASPH (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.82) and COL4A6 (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.97). Morphological differences in the basement membrane were observed between children with CP and TD children. The sarcomere length was significantly increased in children with CP when compared with TD (p = 0.04). These findings show that gene targets in the categories: calcium handling, basement membrane and collagens, were significantly correlated to passive muscle stiffness. A Reactome pathway analysis showed that pathways involved in DNA repair, ECM proteoglycans and ion homeostasis were amongst the most upregulated pathways in CP, while pathways involved in collagen fibril crosslinking, collagen fibril assembly and collagen turnover were amongst the most downregulated pathways when compared with TD children. These results underline that contracture formation and motor impairment in CP is an interplay between multiple factors.
Our study aimed to reveal the underlying pathologic mechanisms of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by integrative transcriptomics and proteomic analysis of extraocular muscles (EOM). The study involved 11 TAO patients (clinical activity score ≤ 2) and 11 control donors. Total RNA was extracted from EOM samples of 5 TAO patients and 5 control individuals for gene microarray analysis to reveal differentially expressed genes. Concurrently, EOM samples from 3 TAO patients and 3 control individuals were lysed for quantitative proteomic analysis. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were identified, followed by functional and pathway enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network construction. Concordance between proteins and transcripts was examined, and functional annotations were conducted. Expressions of versican (VCAN) and lipocalin 1 (LCN1) in EOM samples from another 3 TAO patients and 3 control individuals were measured by western blotting. In total, 952 genes and 137 proteins were identified as differentially expressed, as well as 96 differentially expressed proteins without significantly changed mRNA abundance. Proteins mainly related to the composition (such as MYH1, MYH2, and MYH13) and contraction force (MYH3, MYH8, ACTN3, and TNNT1) of the muscle fibers were significantly up-regulated in EOM samples of TAO, as well as those (such as VCAN, MPZ, and PTPRC) associated with cell adhesion. In addition, differentially expressed proteins related to the components and metabolism of extracellular matrix (ECM) (such as COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, VCAN, OGN, and DCN) were identified. Similarly, expressions of genes involved in cell adhesion and ECM metabolism were significantly different between EOM samples of TAO patients and controls. Western blotting verified that VCAN involved in ECM proteoglycans and diseases associated with glycosaminoglycan metabolism was markedly higher in EOM samples of TAO, whereas LCN1 was obviously decreased. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the significantly altered cellular components of EOM, muscle contraction, cell adhesion and ECM metabolism, which might be involved in the pathologic mechanisms and/or consequences of TAO.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the aquaculture sector, one of the challenges includes disease outbreaks such as bacterial infections, particularly from Aeromonas hydrophila (Ah), impacting both wild and farmed fish. In this study, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the intestinal tissue in Labeo rohita following Ah infection to elucidate the protein alterations and its implications for immune response. Our findings indicate significant dysregulation in extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated proteins during Ah infection, with increased abundance of elastin and collagen alpha-3(VI). Pathway and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins highlights the involvement of ECM-related pathways, including focal adhesions, integrin cell surface interactions, and actin cytoskeleton organization. Focal adhesions, crucial for connecting intracellular actin bundles to the ECM, play a pivotal role in immune response during infections. Increased abundance of integrin alpha 1, integrin beta 1, and tetraspanin suggests their involvement in the host's response to Ah infection. Proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton reorganization, such as myosin, tropomyosin, and phosphoglucomutase, exhibit increased abundance, influencing changes in cell behavior. Additionally, upregulated proteins like LTBP1 and fibrillin-2 contribute to TGF-β signaling and focal adhesion, indicating their potential role in immune regulation. The study also identifies elevated levels of laminin, galectin 3, and tenascin-C, which interact with integrins and other ECM components, potentially influencing immune cell migration and function. These proteins, along with decorin and lumican, may act as immunomodulators, coordinating pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. ECM fragments released during pathogen invasion could serve as "danger signals," initiating pathogen clearance and tissue repair through Toll-like receptor signaling.The study underscores the critical role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its associated proteins in the immune response of aquatic organisms during bacterial infections like Aeromonas hydrophila. Understanding the intricate interplay between ECM alterations and immune response pathways provides crucial insights for developing effective disease control strategies in aquaculture. By identifying key proteins and pathways involved in host defense mechanisms, this research lays the groundwork for targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of bacterial infections on fish health and aquaculture production.
