RHOV and RHOU are considered atypical Rho-family small GTPases because of the existence of N- and C-terminal extension regions, abnormal GDP/GTP cycling, and post-translational modification. Particularly, RHOV and RHOU both have a proline-rich (PR) motif in the N-terminal region. It has been reported that the PR motif of RHOU interacts with GRB2, a SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein, and regulates its activity through EGF receptor signaling. However, it is unknown whether RHOV, like RHOU, interacts with SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins. In this study, we investigated the interactions between RHOV and SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins, including GRB2 and NCK2. The RHOV-induced serum response factor (SRF)-dependent gene transcriptional activity was attenuated in cells co-expressing either GRB2 or NCK2 compared to cells expressing RHOV alone. From the results of experiments using various gene mutants of RHOV and GRB2, it appears that the PR motif of the N-terminal region of RHOV is the crucial binding site for the SH3 domain-containing proteins. Furthermore, we found that Ser25 in the N-terminal region of RHOV is phosphorylated by PKA and that its phosphorylation is suppressed by interaction with NCK2 but not GRB2. We have found a novel regulatory mechanism for the phosphorylation of RHOV and its interaction with SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
